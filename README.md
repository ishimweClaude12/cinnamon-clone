# cinnamon-clone
Cloning cinnamon official webisite using vanilla javascript and tailwindcss.
## Reason for cloning this website 
I used to like bootsrap, thinking that it is easy to customize and build components from the go
but seeing the wonders of tailwind css over the past few weeks of learning and implementing some of its features
I came to a realization that tailwind is much easier than bootstrap.
